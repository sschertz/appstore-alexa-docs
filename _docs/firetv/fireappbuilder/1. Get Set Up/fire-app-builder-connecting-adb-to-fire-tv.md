## Using an Android TV Emulator

If you absolutely cannot use a Fire TV device to test your app, there is limited support for using an emulator. See [Use an Android TV Emulator to Run Your App][fire-app-builder-use-an-android-tv-emulator].

## Next Steps

With ADB all set up, you're ready to [download and build Fire App Builder][fire-app-builder-download-and-build].
