The Amazon Fire TV platform supports user input from the Amazon Fire TV Remote, the Fire TV Voice Remote, the Fire game controller, and other game controllers that support the Bluetooth HID gamepad profile. All controllers must be paired with the device to be used.

All the Amazon Fire TV controllers are Android input devices. You use the same techniques and APIs to manage input from those devices as you would any other Android input device.

In particular, simple input from any controller such as navigation or selection can be managed through key events in the same way you would handle input from a keyboard or a button pad.
